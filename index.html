       "Florida, land of flowers, land of light,<br>
Florida, where our dreams can all take flight,<br>
Whether youth's vibrant morning or the twilight of years,<br>
There are treasures for all who venture here - in Florida".<br>
Mocking birds cry and 'gators lie out in the sun<br>
Bridges span southward to the Keys<br>
and rockets skyward run,<br>
The orange blossoms' sweet perfume<br>
and fireworks fill the air,<br>
and cultures rich, our native people share.</p>
